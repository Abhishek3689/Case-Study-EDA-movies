# Case-Study-EDA-movies
## Analysis Tasks to be performed:
### Import the three datasets
### Create a new dataset [Master_Data] with the following columns MovieID Title UserID Age Gender Occupation Rating. (Hint: (i) Merge two tables at a time. (ii) Merge the tables using two primary keys MovieID & UserId)
### Explore the datasets using visual representations (graphs or tables), also include your comments on the following:
#### 1.User Age Distribution
#### 2.User rating of the movie “Toy Story”
#### 3.Top 25 movies by viewership rating
#### 4.Find the ratings for all the movies reviewed by for a particular user of user id = 2696
## Feature Engineering:
### Use column genres:
#### 1.Find out all the unique genres (Hint: split the data in column genre making a list and then process the data to find out only the unique categories of genres)
#### 2.Create a separate column for each genre category with a one-hot encoding ( 1 and 0) whether or not the movie belongs to that genre.
#### 3.Determine the features affecting the ratings of any particular movie.
#### 4.Develop an appropriate model to predict the movie ratings
